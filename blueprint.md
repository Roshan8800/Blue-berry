# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application for browsing and watching videos. It includes features like video playback, search, categories, user profiles, and settings. The goal of the current initiative is to modernize the UI/UX of the application to provide a more premium, high-quality, and professional user experience.

## Implemented Features & Design

This section will document all the design and features of the application as they are implemented.

*(This section is a living document and will be populated as I work on the project)*

## Current Plan: UI/UX Modernization

The following steps will be taken to improve the UI/UX of the application:

1.  **Establish a Modern Design System:**
    *   Define a new color palette using modern color spaces (e.g., `oklch`).
    *   Implement CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure consistency and easy theming.
    *   Choose a modern, readable, and expressive font family.
    *   Add a subtle noise texture to the background for a premium feel.
    *   Implement a consistent spacing and layout system.

2.  **Enhance Component Styles with Animations:**
    *   **Video Player:** Redesign the video player controls with a focus on usability and aesthetics. Add smooth animations for controls appearing and disappearing.
    *   **Navigation:** Improve the navigation drawer with a smooth slide-in/slide-out animation and modern styling.
    *   **Buttons and Interactive Elements:** Add hover and active states with subtle animations and "glow" effects. Implement multi-layered drop shadows for a sense of depth.
    *   **Cards/Thumbnails:** Redesign video thumbnails and other card-like elements with soft, deep shadows to make them appear "lifted".
    *   **Loading States:** Implement more engaging loading spinners or skeletons.

3.  **Improve Layout and Responsiveness:**
    *   Review and improve the overall layout for better visual balance and information hierarchy.
    *   Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices. Use container queries where appropriate.

4.  **Incorporate Modern Iconography:**
    *   Replace existing icons with a modern, consistent icon set to improve clarity and aesthetics.

5.  **Iterative Refinement:**
    *   Continuously check for visual and functional regressions after each change.
    *   Ensure all accessibility standards are maintained or improved.
